      <h3>2019-2022</h3>
      <p>My first few years studying at Brunel Univeristy London. Starting foundation year, I was re-introduced to the basics of programming in more depth through Visual Basic, and also took an Algebra course aswell. In the following years, I would study and use technology for more topics such as networks, machine learning and project management.</p>
      <p>During this period, I would partake in various group based projects. Communication became increasingly important, and its gradual increase of importance became a spike when lockdown began, courtesy of COVID-19. Taking the initiative when it came to contacting group members became a common occurence, and I learned about team dynamics and gained hands-on experience with methodologies such as Agile and Waterfall.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adopted various technologies related to different aspects of computer science and overall project management, such as Java, HTML/CSS, Azure, VirtualBox, Trello, Github and more.</li>
        <li>Worked on various group based projects, often being required to lead deliverables and co-ordinate group meetings.</li>
        <li>Participated in Made In Brunel 2022 and won the Emerge-IQ Project Prize for Software Innovation, based on a second year group project.</li>
        <li>Joined the eSports club and did well in some Smash Bros tournaments.</li>

My main responsibilities included assisting clients with accessing their dashboards on FedEx's domain, on top of assisting with the development of these dashboards. I would also get involved in many different projects, and I would even get the chance to lead my own projects.</p>
      <p>As my first professional experience in the IT field, it was naturally a huge shift from usual academics. The standard was significatly higher in regards to working within a team, and I learned to quickly adapt within a fast-paced environment.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gained experience with Process Mining, Task Mining and Data Mining through training and on-the-job experience.</li>
        <li>Learned to use various technology designed for Data Analysis and Visualisation, like Celonis, Power BI, SQL and more.</li>
        <li>Developed the Process Intelligence team website, a SharePoint website designed to explain Process Intelligence and bridge the gap between us and clients in terms of communication.</li>
        <li>Underwent formal training on SAFe 5 (Scaled Agile Framework) and earned certification.</li>
        <li>Incrementally built machine learning algorithms for text categorisation and sentiment analysis.</li>
        <li>Delivered various presentations regarding my work at FedEx for different teams and managers.</li>

      <h3>2023-2024</h3>
      <p>My final year of university, including my final year modules and dissertation project. This year would start off with my chosen modules of: Digital Media and Games, Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

      <p>The second term would have me entirely focused on my dissertation project. The aim of my project was tackling the never-ending issue of cybersecurity awareness and training by developing an educational game that could do both. Alongside this, I would be taking extra lectures to learn about advanced topics such as LLMs, Blockchain technology and Virtual Reality. My studies would finish in May, where I would sit my final exams after submitting my dissertation the month prior. I graduated from Brunel University London on the 16th of July 2024.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deepened my understanding of specific subjects such as coding standards, game development, deep learning, software metrics and more.</li>
        <li>Completed an 82 page long dissertation project on cybersecurity, developing an educational game. My paper would recieve an A.</li>
        <li>Graduated on the 16th of July with a First Class Honours in Computer Science(Digital Media and Games).</li>

      <p>There are some projects that I started during university which I am continuing in my free time, such as a 2D Platformer game which I developed a demo for as part of the Digital Media course. I am also revisiting cloud technology through Azure. And of course I have plenty of time for my hobbies, including digital art.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Continuing development of 2D Platformer game in Unity.</li>
        <li>Taking online courses for several technologies, including Microsoft Azure and web technologies.</li>
